# Algorithms and Data Structures (AED)

This repository contains problem statements and solutions developed throughout the **AED (Algorithms and Data Structures)** course.  

---

## Repository Structure

- Each problem is documented in a separate markdown file:
  ```
  aed001.md
  aed002.md
  aed003.md
  ...
  ```
- Each file contains:
  - Problem description  
  - Input/output format  
  - Constraints  
  - Examples  

- Corresponding source code solutions (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.py`, etc.) are provided alongside these markdown files.

---

## How to Use

1. Open any problem statement file (e.g., `aed00X.md`) to read the description.  
2. Review the corresponding code implementation.  
3. Compile or run the solution depending on the language used:
   ```bash
   g++ aed00X.cpp -o aed00X
   ./aed00X
   ```
