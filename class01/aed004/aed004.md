# [AED004] Bart's Math Problem

Bart Simpson is in trouble again. Mrs. Krabappel has given him math homework, and this time it's serious: **prime factorization**.  
While Bart would rather be skateboarding, watching Krusty, or pulling pranks on Principal Skinner, he knows he has to get it done or risk detention.

The task seems simple: given a list of numbers, Bart must break each of them down into their prime factors.  
But Bart is tired and distracted, so he’s asking you to help him out.

## The Problem

Given a list of integers, output the prime factorization of each number in the list.

---

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer **N**, the number of integers in the list.  
- The second line contains **N** space-separated integers `a_i`.

---

## Output

- The output should contain **N** lines, one for each number in the list.  
- Each line should be in the format:

```
a_i = p1*p2*...*pk
```

where `p_j` are the prime factors of the number in increasing order.  
There should be no spaces between the symbols.

---

## Constraints

- **1 ≤ N ≤ 100** — quantity of numbers  
- **2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10⁹** — numbers in the list

---

## Example

**Input**
```
4
6 630 100 13
```

**Output**
```
6=2*3
630=2*3*3*5*7
100=2*2*5*5
13=13
```
