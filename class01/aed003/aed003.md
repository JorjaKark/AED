# [AED003] Space Oddity

The radio crackles, and [Major Tom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Tom) drifts weightlessly inside his capsule. Earth is a blue planet far behind him, and the stars shine silently all around. The farther he floats, the stranger he feels an *odd* sensation he cannot quite explain.

As if reading his thoughts, Mission Control transmits a sequence of numbers. To them, it's just routine telemetry. But Major Tom interprets the message differently: to him, the odd numbers in the list resonate with his lonely strangeness, while the even numbers fade into the background like static in the void.

He wonders: how many odd signals are hidden in the transmission? And what is the last odd number he can cling to, before drifting deeper into the great unknown?

Your task is to help Major Tom decipher the message before he loses contact.

## The Problem

Given a sequence of positive integers, count how many of them are odd and output both that count and the last odd number in the sequence.

---

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer **N**, the number of integers in the sequence.  
- The second line contains **N** space-separated integers `a_i`.

---

## Output

The output should be a line with two integers separated by a space:

1. The count of odd numbers in the sequence.  
2. The last odd number in the sequence.  

If there are no odd numbers, output `0 -1`.

---

## Constraints

- **1 ≤ N ≤ 100** — size of sequence  
- **1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10⁹** — numbers in the sequence

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**
```
5
42 17 8 23 100
```

**Output**
```
2 23
```
There are two odd numbers (17 and 23) and the last one is 23.

---

### Example 2
**Input**
```
4
2 4 6 8
```

**Output**
```
0 -1
```
There are no odd numbers.
