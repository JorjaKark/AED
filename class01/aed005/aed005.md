# [AED005] Number Spiral

Imagine the following number spiral (starts at **01** at the origin and increases as it spirals out). We use a 2D coordinate system **(X, Y)** where:
- **01** is at **(0, 0)**
- **02** is at **(1, 0)**
- **03** is at **(1, −1)**
- **04** is at **(0, −1)**
- **05** is at **(−1, −1)**
- …and so on, following the spiral shown.

## The Problem

Given a number **N**, compute its coordinates **(X, Y)** on the number spiral.

---

## Input

A single line containing the integer **N** — the number to locate on the spiral.

---

## Output

A single line containing **(X, Y)** — the coordinates of **N** on the spiral, as defined above.

---

## Constraints

- **1 ≤ N ≤ 10¹⁴**

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**
```
5
```

**Output**
```
(-1,-1)
```

---

### Example 2
**Input**
```
26
```

**Output**
```
(3,2)
```
