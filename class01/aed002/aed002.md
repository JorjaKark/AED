# [AED002] Unlucky Numbers

Many cultures consider certain numbers *unlucky*. For example, in several European countries the number **13** is seen as a symbol of bad luck, while in many Asian countries the number **4** is avoided due to its similarity in pronunciation to the word "death".

In this problem, you are given a list of integers and a specific unlucky number and must filter out all occurrences of the unlucky number.

---

## The Problem

Given a list of **N** integers and an unlucky number **X**, count how many integers are different from **X** and then output those numbers in their original order.

---

## Input

- The first line contains two integers **N** and **X**, where **N** is the number of integers in the list and **X** is the unlucky number.  
- The second line contains **N** space-separated integers `a_i`, representing the list.  
- It is guaranteed that **at least one** of the integers will **not** be unlucky.

---

## Output

- The first line must contain a single integer: the number of integers in the list that are **not** equal to **X**.  
- The second line must contain those integers, separated by single spaces, in the same order as they appeared in the input.

---

## Constraints

- **1 ≤ N ≤ 100** — size of the initial list  
- **1 ≤ X ≤ 10⁹** — unlucky number  
- **1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10⁹** — numbers in the list

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**
```
8 13
13 2 31 13 13 7 25 13
```

**Output**
```
4
2 31 7 25
```
There are four numbers (2, 31, 7 and 25) that are not the unlucky 13.

---

### Example 2
**Input**
```
5 4
42 4 4 4 4
```

**Output**
```
1
42
```
In this example there is only one number that is not the unlucky number, which is 42.
