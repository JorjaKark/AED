# [AED001] Forty-Two

Everyone knows that [42 is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).  
Now you just need to make a program that puts that into practice!

---

## The Problem

Given a sequence of **N** integer numbers, your task is to count the amount of times the number **42** appears.

---

## Input

- The first line of input contains **N**, the quantity of numbers to process.  
- The second line of input contains **N** integer numbers `a_i`, separated by single spaces.

---

## Output

A single line containing the amount of times the number 42 appears, that is, how many of the `a_i` numbers are equal to 42.

---

## Constraints

- **1 ≤ N ≤ 100** (quantity of numbers to consider)  
- **1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10⁹** (range of each number)

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  
```
7
2 42 42 6 42 999 5
```

**Output**  
```
3
```
In this example there are three 42's in the numbers given.

---

### Example 2
**Input**  
```
5
78 234 1024 1 14
```

**Output**  
```
0
```
In this example there are no 42's in the numbers given.
